This is a basic implementation of the snake game.

To play the game:

	Your operating system must have the 'curses' library installed.
	This is usually the case with Linux-based systems.

	If your python version is 2.7 then use python3.
	python3 snake.py

	If python version 3.6 is the default version:
	python snake.py

To find the python version , type in the terminal:

	python --version

If the above version is 2.x.x , type python3 instead of python.


Ensure that the terminal is full screen for the duration of the game.

Sometimes the game will not render properly even if the terminal is full screen if the font size is too big.
Try changing the font size of the terminal until the entire game fits into the screen.

To change the font size , go to:

	Edit	->		Preferences

Resizing the terminal during the game will cause errors.

Other comments will be found within the code.

Happy playing!
